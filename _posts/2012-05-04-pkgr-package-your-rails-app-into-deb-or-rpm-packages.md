I just released <a href="http://crohr.me/pkgr/">pkgr</a>, a gem that helps packaging your Rails app into a debian (DEB) package (RPM support is coming next). It's still early days, but if you're deploying on Debian Squeeze using Rails 3.2, it should work fine.

In the short future I'll have to verify that it works on existing apps :)
