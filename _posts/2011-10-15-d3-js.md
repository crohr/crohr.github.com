Late to the party, but [Protovis](http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/), the great JavaScript visualization library by the Standford Visualization Group, is replaced by [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/).

> D3.js is a small, free JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

Looks great!
