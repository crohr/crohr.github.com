Started a series of trainings. Enjoyable and exhausting at the same time.

* [Automatic SketchUp: Creating 3-D Models in Ruby](http://www.autosketchup.com/) - Great (free) book for learning how to use the [SketchUp Ruby API](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/) to build 3D models programmatically.
* [Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods](http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/) - Good list. Also, interesting note about the social aspects of distributed systems.
* [Timeline JS](http://timeline.verite.co/) - Javascript library to display timelines.
* [twitter/secureheaders](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) - Security related HTTP headers all in one gem.
* [More than you ever wanted to know about "this" in JavaScript](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2013/01/this.md#more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-this-in-javascript-part-i) - A good post by [Reg Braithwaite](http://braythwayt.com/).
* [rogerwang/node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) - Write native apps in HTML and Javascript and call Node.js modules directly. App runtime based on Chromium and node.js. Then you can package your apps for all platforms.
* [Understand the Favicon](http://www.jonathantneal.com/blog/understand-the-favicon/) - Not so simple.
* [Taking payments online (in Europe) in 2013](http://jamesmaskell.co.uk/2013/online-payments-in-2013/) - Still harder in Europe than in the US.
* [Auto-Forwarding Carousels and Accordions Annoy Users and Reduce Visibility](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/) - "The user's target was at the top of the page in 98-point font. But she failed to find it because the panel auto-rotated instead of staying still"
