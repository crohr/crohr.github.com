February already. 2013 looks like a rough year for Rails & Ruby.

* [What The Rails Security Issue Means For Your Startup](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-issue-means-for-your-startup/) - "Blood in the water attracts sharks".
* [rubygems/rubygems-aws](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-aws) - Following the security breach on rubygems.org, a team went on to rebuild the full rubygems infrastructure in a fully automated way to deploy it on new machines (before it was all manually done). This is a very good example of how to use a mix of Capistrano, Vagrant, AWS, Chef (solo) and librarian-chef to manage, test and deploy your infrastructure. Replace Chef and librarian-chef with Puppet and librarian-puppet at your convenience ;)
* [rcrowley/freight](https://github.com/rcrowley/freight/) - A tool to release Debian archives in an easy way. Part of the ["Debian packaging for busy people"](http://rcrowley.org/articles/packaging.html) toolset.
* [Ops School Curriculum](http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/) - An attempt at documenting what you need to know to become an Ops. 
* [Why We (Still) Believe in Working Remotely](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/?cb=1) - By the folks at StackExchange (StackOverflow & cie). Good press for Google Hangouts, which is indeed really great for video group chat and collaboration.
* [Why does Google append while(1); in front of their JSON responses?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2669690/why-does-google-append-while1-in-front-of-their-json-responses) - Clever hack for cross-site request forgery prevention.
