# SSL Renegociation problems with OpenSSL 0.9.8l
If the SSL connection to your `Apache` server hangs while trying to make a renegociation, here is why: <http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=7543>.
In short, to deal with a security issue, OpenSSL no longer honors SSL renegociation:

> Due to the recent publishing of information regarding a TLS/SSL protocol vulnerability (previous ISC diary entry can be found here http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=7534)  OpenSSL has released a new version (OpenSSL 0.9.8l). It should be noted that this update does not "fix" the vulnerability in the protocol. It appears that they have made the choice to simply remove TLS/SSL renegotiation from their package by default.

Instead, it just hangs:

    [... hangs ...]

The renegociation was due to my Apache configuration: the `SSLOptions`, `SSLVerifyClient`, `SSLVerifyDepth` directives trigger an SSL renegociation at the directory level. Setting them at the `VirtualHost` level solves the problem, even though it may not be possible for you to do so if they are directory-specific.

The configuration that caused the renegociation to occur was as follows:

    <VirtualHost *:443>
    ...
      <Location />
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all

        SSLOptions -StrictRequire
        SSLVerifyClient optional
        SSLUserName SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN
        SSLVerifyDepth 2
        SSLRequireSSL

        SSLRequire %{SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_CN} eq "xxx"

        # fall back to Basic Auth
        AuthType Basic
        AuthBasicProvider ldap
        AuthName "Please authenticate"
        AuthLDAPURL ldaps://ldap-server:636/dc=xxx,dc=fr?uid
        AuthzLDAPAuthoritative Off
        AuthLDAPGroupAttribute memberUid
        AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN Off
        require valid-user

        Satisfy Any
      </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

And the new configuration is:

    <VirtualHost *:443>
    ...
      SSLOptions -StrictRequire
      SSLVerifyClient optional
      SSLUserName SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN
      SSLVerifyDepth 2
      
      <Location />
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all

        SSLRequireSSL
        SSLRequire %{SSL_CLIENT_I_DN_CN} eq "xxx"

        # fall back to Basic Auth
        AuthType Basic
        AuthBasicProvider ldap
        AuthName "Please authenticate"
        AuthLDAPURL ldaps://ldap-server:636/dc=xxx,dc=fr?uid
        AuthzLDAPAuthoritative Off
        AuthLDAPGroupAttribute memberUid
        AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN Off
        require valid-user

        Satisfy Any
      </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

See <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html> for the list of directives that trigger a renegociation.
