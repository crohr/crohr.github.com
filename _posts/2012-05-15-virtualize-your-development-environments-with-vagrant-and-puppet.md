Yesterday I presented the Vagrant & Puppet tools at the Rails Bar in
Rennes, to show how you can use these tools to easily provision virtual
machines that can be used as isolated development environments for your
projects. You'll keep your development machine fast, your environments
isolated (+ they replicate your production setup), and any developer
will be able to get up and running on a new project in less than 5
minutes.
