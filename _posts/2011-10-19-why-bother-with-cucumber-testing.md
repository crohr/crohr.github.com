> Cucumber has its uses, principally as a high level analysis tool on large, polyglot projects. That said, few programmers work in this kind of position, and acceptance tests beyond a list of the method names of regular integration tests seems wasteful. 

Perfectly represents my opinion. System testing of a platform made of several apps written in different languages works very well, because you'll be forced to stay at a high level of abstraction. But within a single app, I'm not sure it's worth it (or keep the feature set very small and high level).
