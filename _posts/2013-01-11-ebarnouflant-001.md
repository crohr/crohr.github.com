This year I'm going to try something new, i.e. publish every week a list
of links, mainly about Web development, Freelancing, DevOps, etc. The
goal is not necessarily to post the most awesome or recent links, but
things that I've found to be useful or interesting in my daily work.

Inspiration for this mainly comes from the *Double Shot* series on [Mike
Gunderloy's website](http://afreshcup.com/), as you always end up
finding a few links to interesting
discussions/posts/products/libraries/people that you didn't know about.
It's also a more paced alternative to Twitter for finding links.

This series will be called *Ebarnouflant*, which is a French word to
express a mixture of "wow/awesome/cool/crazy/unbelievable" feelings
about something. I hope you'll (re)discover at least something every
week.

Let's start with this week's links:
