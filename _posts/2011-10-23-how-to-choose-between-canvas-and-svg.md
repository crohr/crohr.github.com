> Wherever you see a large number of pixels or images, this is a good clue that Canvas is the technology to useâ€”whether this is astronomy, biological cellular movement, or voice modulation displays. The limits here on how fast data can be visualized are the speed of the CPU, the speed of the Canvas implementation, and the speed of the JavaScript implementation.

Very good review. Having had to make a decision on whether to use SVG or Canvas for a jQuery Gantt plugin (decision was Canvas), there are cases where it's difficult to choose between both technologies. And keep in mind that native SVG support is absent from IE < 9.
