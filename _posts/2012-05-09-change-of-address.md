I've decided to move this collection of notes off of Tumblr and back to my
main site at [crohr.me](http://crohr.me). Thanks to Feedburner, the Atom feed
address will stay the same, but it's more than likely that you'll get a large
list of new (but already published) articles in your feed reader due to the
switch.

Tumblr is good, but I prefer adding articles without quitting my standard
workflow (text editor + git). Plus this will be better integrated with my main
site. For those interested, I used this [simple migration script] [script] to
import the existing articles from Tumblr to my Jekyll-powered site.

I also took the time to change the site design, and put in place a responsive
design based on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/). There is still a lot of
room for improvement, but I'm quite happy with the result.
