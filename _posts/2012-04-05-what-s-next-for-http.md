Mark Nottingham, about HTTP/1.1:

> The HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC2616) was standardised in the mid-to-late 90’s. At the time, there was a lot of pressure to produce something quickly, because the Web was getting popular, and swamping a lot of networks in the process. As a result, the spec is somewhat garbled.

So here comes preliminary work towards HTTP/2.0:

> On Thursday, we started executing on a new charter that will see us do that by gathering requirements, soliciting proposals and — with a lot of work and a bit of luck — start working on HTTP/2.0 in a few months.

Good news!
