Hi OBS team!

My name is Cyril Rohr, I'm currently working as a Freelance doing Ruby &
RubyOnRails consulting work, but I must say I'm interested in knowing
more about the "Service Engineer Build Services" job offer [1] that
Peter Linnell forwarded to me.

I've spent 4 years at the Inria research institute in France, working on
RESTful API design, client tools and web interfaces for Grid computing
and Cloud computing platforms. I've also become recently interested in
the packaging world, mainly for Ruby applications (I just released
`pkgr`, a Ruby gem to package Rails apps as debian packages).

I appreciate the work you've done with the Open Build Service, and would
be really eager to know more about what you're doing, your future plans,
and whether I could be a good fit for your team.

You can find a lot more about me, my projects, and peer recommendations
on my personal website [2], github account [3], and linkedin account
[4].

Finally, if you want to contact me, please note that I'll be traveling
abroad from August 27th to September 10th, with intermittent access to
my emails.
