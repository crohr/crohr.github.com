## Education

In 2008, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science with high honours from the
*Institut National des Sciences Appliquées* ([INSA] [insa]), a French
engineering [*Grande École*] [grande-ecole] in Lyon, France.

I had a great time doing my final year of education and a bit of research at
the *Queensland University of Technology* ([QUT] [qut]) in Brisbane,
Australia.

## Work Experience

* From Oct. 2008 to Mar. 2012, I worked as a R&amp;D Engineer at the
  [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) national research institute in Rennes, France.

  I originally started to work on the [Grid'5000](http://www.grid5000.fr/)
  project, an infrastructure distributed in 9 sites around France for research
  in large-scale parallel and distributed systems. In Aug. 2010 I also joined
  the EU founded [BonFIRE](http://bonfire-project.eu/) project to work on a
  multi-site cloud facility.

  I was mainly in charge of designing, implementing and operating a
  distributed software architecture based on RESTful APIs. I also built web
  interfaces and visualizations using standard and lightweight technologies
  such as HTML5, Javascript, CSS.

  My day-to-day work usually involved me writing code using a mix of Ruby,
  Javascript, HTML and CSS; pushing and pulling with Git; messing with DEB and
  RPM packages; cooking some Puppet recipes to configure and deploy two dozens
  of servers; and trying to bend big-old Apache and Squid to my will.

* From Jan. to Jul. 2008, I was a Research Intern at the [Queensland Institute
  of Technology](http://qut.edu.au/) in Brisbane, Australia, where I worked on
  Cross-Media summarization and Video processing.

  My research project consisted in designing and building a solution to crawl,
  index and process media content (text, videos and images) from hundreds of
  online news sources to provide an aggregated view of the day-to-day news
  information flow. A (then) innovative browser-based interface was also built
  for browsing and filtering the resulting news events (see
  [Publications](#publications)).

  I also participated in the international [TRECVid](http://trecvid.nist.gov/)
  workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
  ([NIST](http://www.nist.gov/)), devoted to research in automatic
  segmentation, indexing, and content-based retrieval of digital video (see
  [Publications](#publications)).

* In 2007, I worked for 3 months as a Software Engineer Intern for the
  [Kalistick](http://kalistick.com/) startup (*Agile quality for continuous
  delivery*) in Lyon, France.

  This internship brought me a lot of knowledge about software quality,
  testing, and best-practices. I mainly worked with Java, code analyzers,
  rules engines and business intelligence tools.

* In 2006, I worked for 2 months as a Software Developer Intern for [Les Bains
  de l'Opéra](http://lesbainsdelopera.com/) in Lyon, France, where I developed
  a web intranet application to replace their invoicing and customer
  management tool. At that time, I mainly worked with PHP5, HTML and what was
  called AJAX.

  This internship was particularly important since I discovered and played
  with Ruby on Rails during my spare time at work ;-)

## Publications

I had a brief but fulfilling research experience during the last 6 months of
my education. Below are the two articles I (co)-authored:

* **Cyril Rohr** and Dian Tjondronegoro. 2008. [*Aggregated cross-media news
  visualization and
  personalization*](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1460157). In
  Proceeding of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia information
  retrieval (MIR '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 371-378.

* Johannes Sasongko, **Cyril Rohr**, and Dian Tjondronegoro. 2008. [*Efficient
  generation of pleasant video
  summaries*](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1463563.1463585). In
  Proceedings of the 2nd ACM TRECVid Video Summarization Workshop (TVS '08).
  ACM, New York, NY, USA, 119-123.

And below is an article I co-authored while at Inria:
