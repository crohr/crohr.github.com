## Code

Here is some software I've written in my spare time or that my previous
employers allowed me to publicly release.

* [pkgr] [pkgr] - Easily package your Rails app into deb or rpm packages.
  After a few months of dealing with the various intricacies of packaging Ruby
  apps for debian or centos, here is a gem that does everything for you.

* [restfully] [restfully] - A Ruby client for RESTful APIs.

* [rest-client-components] [components] - [Rack] [rack] should not be limited
  to HTTP servers, it's also a very good client-side abstraction for pluggable
  middleware!

* [g5k-campaign] [g5k-campaign] - A tool to launch experiment campaigns on
  [Grid'5000] [grid5000], based on the concept of extensible campaign engines.

* [syslogger] [syslogger] - Finally a proper `syslog` library for Ruby. Can be
  used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `Logger` library.

* [toggl-notifier] [toggl-notifier] - Hack! Update your Adium status with the
  description of your current task in [Toggl](http://toggl.com) (Mac only).
