I'm 26, passionate about the Ruby programming language, information retrieval,
machine learning techniques, distributed software architectures, and web
development in general.

**I'm looking for freelance work starting April 2012**.

[At work](https://www.grid5000.fr), I build easy-to-use HTTP APIs that closely
follow the REST principles, deployed on a geographically distributed
infrastructure I try to make as scalable and fault-tolerant as possible. More
recently, I've been involved in projects around cloud computing and
virtualization.

I keep a log at [Ebarnouflant](http://ebarnouflant.com), and you can also find
me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/crohr). I also write some
[code](http://github.com/crohr).

I currently live in [Rennes, France] [location]. You can drop me a line at
**contact@crohr.me**. French readers can find a Résumé (CV) here:
[cv-fr.pdf](/cv-fr.pdf).

## Code

Here are some software I've written in my spare time or that my employer has
allowed me to publicly release.

* [restfully] [restfully] - A Ruby client for RESTful APIs.

* [rest-client-components] [components] - [Rack] [rack] should not be limited
  to HTTP servers, it's also a very good client-side abstraction for pluggable
  middleware!

* [g5k-campaign] [g5k-campaign] - A tool to launch experiment campaigns on
  [Grid'5000] [grid5000], based on the concept of extensible campaign engines.

* [syslogger] [syslogger] - Finally a proper `syslog` library for Ruby. Can be
  used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `Logger` library.

* [toggl-notifier] [toggl-notifier] - Hack! Update your Adium status with the
  description of your current task in [Toggl](http://toggl.com) (Mac only).

## Screencasts

Most of the code I produced has been within INRIA. Thanks to the following
screencast, you can have a small overview of what I've done there:

The screencast above presents the user interface I built on top of the APIs I
developed for the Grid'5000 platform. It shows how you can select and reserve
physical nodes on the infrastructure, launch a script on those nodes, register
metrics through the [Ganglia] [ganglia] tool, and visualize results, all from
a web interface. This UI uses a number of Javascript libraries, among which
[jQuery] [jquery], [Simile Exhibit] [exhibit], and [Protovis] [protovis] (now
replaced by [D3.js] [d3js]). On the backend there is a number of RESTful APIs
developed with Ruby and Sinatra/Rails. The page that allows to graph metrics
takes the data from an API I developed on top of the [RRD] [rrd] files
generated by [Ganglia] [ganglia].

## Education

In 2008, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science with high honours from the
*Institut National des Sciences Appliquées* ([INSA] [insa]), a French
engineering [*Grande École*] [grande-ecole] in Lyon, France.

I had a great time doing my final year of education and a bit of research at
the *Queensland University of Technology* ([QUT] [qut]) in Brisbane,
Australia.

## Work Experience

* Since Oct. 2008, I work as a R&amp;D Engineer at the
  [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) national research institute in Rennes, France.

  I originally started to work on the [Grid'5000](http://www.grid5000.fr/)
  project, an infrastructure distributed in 9 sites around France for research
  in large-scale parallel and distributed systems. In Aug. 2010 I also joined
  the EU founded [BonFIRE](http://bonfire-project.eu/) project to work on a
  multi-site cloud facility.

  I'm mainly in charge of designing, implementing and operating a distributed
  software architecture based on RESTful APIs. I also build web interfaces and
  visualizations using standard and lightweight technologies such as HTML5,
  Javascript, CSS.

  My day-to-day work usually involves me writing code using a mix of Ruby,
  Javascript, HTML and CSS; pushing and pulling with Git; messing with DEB and
  RPM packages; cooking some Puppet recipes to configure and deploy two dozens
  of servers; and trying to bend big-old Apache and Squid to my will.

* From Jan. to Jul. 2008, I was a Research Intern at the [Queensland Institute
  of Technology](http://qut.edu.au/) in Brisbane, Australia, where I worked on
  Cross-Media summarization and Video processing.

  My research project consisted in designing and building a solution to crawl,
  index and process media content (text, videos and images) from hundreds of
  online news sources to provide an aggregated view of the day-to-day news
  information flow. A (then) innovative browser-based interface was also built
  for browsing and filtering the resulting news events (see
  [Publications](#publications)).

  I also participated in the international [TRECVid](http://trecvid.nist.gov/)
  workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
  ([NIST](http://www.nist.gov/)), devoted to research in automatic
  segmentation, indexing, and content-based retrieval of digital video (see
  [Publications](#publications)).

* In 2007, I worked for 3 months as a Software Engineer Intern for the
  [Kalistick](http://kalistick.com/) startup (*Agile quality for continuous
  delivery*) in Lyon, France.

  This internship brought me a lot of knowledge about software quality,
  testing, and best-practices. I mainly worked with Java, code analyzers,
  rules engines and business intelligence tools.

* In 2006, I worked for 2 months as a Software Developer Intern for [Les Bains
  de l'Opéra](http://lesbainsdelopera.com/) in Lyon, France, where I developed
  a web intranet application to replace their invoicing and customer
  management tool. At that time, I mainly worked with PHP5, HTML and what was
  called AJAX.

  This internship was particularly important since I discovered and played
  with Ruby on Rails during my spare time at work ;-)

## Publications

I had a brief but fulfilling research experience during 6 months. Below are
the two articles I (co)-authored:

* **Cyril Rohr** and Dian Tjondronegoro. 2008. [*Aggregated cross-media news
  visualization and
  personalization*](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1460157). In
  Proceeding of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia information
  retrieval (MIR '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 371-378.

* Johannes Sasongko, **Cyril Rohr**, and Dian Tjondronegoro. 2008. [*Efficient
  generation of pleasant video
  summaries*](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1463563.1463585). In
