I'm a 25 years old software engineer, passionate about the Ruby programming language, information retrieval, machine learning techniques, distributed software architectures, and web development in general.

[At work](https://www.grid5000.fr), I build easy-to-use HTTP APIs that closely follow the REST principles, deployed on a geographically distributed infrastructure I try to make as scalable and fault-tolerant as possible.
More recently, I've been involved in projects around cloud computing and virtualization.

When I find something interesting or useful, I try to [write](/blog) or [twit](http://twitter.com/crohr) about it.
When I don't find something I need, I try to write some [code](http://github.com/crohr).

You can drop me a line at contact@crohr.me.

## Code
Here are some software I've written in my spare time or that my employer has allowed me to publicly release.

* [restfully](http://github.com/crohr/restfully) -
  A Ruby client for RESTful APIs.

* [rest-client-components](http://github.com/crohr/rest-client-components) -
  [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.com) should not be limited to HTTP servers, it's also a very good client-side abstraction for pluggable middleware!

* [g5k-campaign](http://g5k-campaign.gforge.inria.fr/) -
  A tool to launch experiment campaigns on [Grid'5000](http://www.grid5000.fr/), based on the concept of extensible campaign engines.

* [syslogger](http://github.com/crohr/syslogger) -
  Finally a proper `syslog` library for Ruby. Can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `Logger` library.

* [toggl-notifier](http://github.com/crohr/toggl-notifier) -
  Hack! Update your Adium status with the description of your current task in [Toggl](http://toggl.com) (Mac only).

## Education
In 2008, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science with high honours from the *Institut National des Sciences Appliquées* ([INSA](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/)), a French engineering [*Grande École*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_%C3%A9coles) in Lyon, France.

I had a great time doing my final year of education and a bit of research at the *Queensland University of Technology* ([QUT](http://qut.edu.au)) in Brisbane, Australia.

## Work Experience
* Since Oct. 2008, I work as a R&amp;D Engineer at the [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) national research institute in Rennes, France.

  I originally started to work on the [Grid'5000](http://www.grid5000.fr/) project, an infrastructure distributed in 9 sites around France for research in large-scale parallel and distributed systems.
  In Aug. 2010 I also joined the EU founded [BonFIRE](http://bonfire-project.eu/) project to work on a multi-site cloud facility.

  I'm mainly in charge of designing, implementing and operating a distributed software architecture based on RESTful APIs.
  I also build web interfaces and visualizations using standard and lightweight technologies such as HTML5, Javascript, CSS.

  My day-to-day work usually involves me writing code using a mix of Ruby, Javascript, HTML and CSS; pushing and pulling with Git; messing with DEB and RPM packages; cooking some Puppet recipes to configure and deploy two dozens of servers; and trying to bend big-old Apache and Squid to my will.

* From Jan. to Jul. 2008, I was a Research Intern at the [Queensland Institute of Technology](http://qut.edu.au/) in Brisbane, Australia, where I worked on Cross-Media summarization and Video processing.

  My research project consisted in designing and building a solution to crawl, index and process media content (text, videos and images) from hundreds of online news sources to provide an aggregated view of the day-to-day news information flow.
  A (then) innovative browser-based interface was also built for browsing and filtering the resulting news events (see [Publications](#publications)).

  I also participated in the international [TRECVid](http://trecvid.nist.gov/) workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST](http://www.nist.gov/)), devoted to research in automatic segmentation, indexing, and content-based retrieval of digital video (see [Publications](#publications)).

* In 2007, I worked for 3 months as a Software Engineer Intern for the [Kalistick](http://kalistick.com/) startup (*Agile quality for continuous delivery*) in Lyon, France.

  This internship brought me a lot of knowledge about software quality, testing, and best-practices. I mainly worked with Java, code analyzers, rules engines and business intelligence tools.

* In 2006, I worked for 2 months as a Software Developer Intern for [Les Bains de l'Opéra](http://lesbainsdelopera.com/) in Lyon, France, where I developed a web intranet application to replace their invoicing and customer management tool. At that time, I mainly worked with PHP5, HTML and what was called AJAX.

  This internship was particularly important since I discovered and played with Ruby on Rails during my spare time at work ;-)

## Publications
I had a brief but fulfilling research experience during 6 months. Below are the two articles I (co)-authored:

* **Cyril Rohr** and Dian Tjondronegoro. 2008. [*Aggregated cross-media news visualization and personalization*](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1460157). In Proceeding of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia information retrieval (MIR '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 371-378.

* Johannes Sasongko, **Cyril Rohr**, and Dian Tjondronegoro. 2008. [*Efficient generation of pleasant video summaries*](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1463563.1463585). In Proceedings of the 2nd ACM TRECVid Video Summarization Workshop (TVS '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 119-123.
