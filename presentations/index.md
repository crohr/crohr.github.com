## Take a REST!

This presentation explains why you should probably go with the lightweight
approach of using HTTP for building your distributed software architecture. I
explain where we come from, starting with monolithic applications to the SOA
trend and now the "RESTful" style. Proponents of architectures based on the
WS-* standards argue that this technology allows for more features and is
necessary for enterprisey applications. This presentation shows how you can
achieve the same results using HTTP and the REST principles, and I even go
through an example at the end to show how one could implement an advanced
feature such as SLA negotiation at runtime, without all the machinery coming
with the use of WS-* technologies.
