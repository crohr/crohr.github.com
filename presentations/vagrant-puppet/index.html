<p>This talk is about using Vagrant &amp; Puppet to easily provision virtual
machines that can be used as isolated development environments for your
projects. You'll keep your development machine fast, your environments
isolated, and any developer will be able to get up and running on a new
project in less than 5 minutes.</p>
