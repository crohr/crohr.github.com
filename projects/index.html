<h2>Flag.io</h2>

<a href="http://flag.io"><img src="/images/flagio-resized.png" width="100%" /></a>

<p><strong>Upload files from your terminal</strong>. Tired of having to open a
web browser to upload some files and make them available to people on the Web?
Donâ€™t want to remember a complicated API to do it on the command line? <a
href="http://flag.io">Flag.io</a> is designed to be the simplest way to upload
a file from the command line.</p>

<h2>Grid'5000 Web UI</h2>

<p> The screencast above presents the user interface I built on top of the
APIs I developed for the Grid'5000 platform. It shows how you can select and
reserve physical nodes on the infrastructure, launch a script on those nodes,
register metrics through the <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/"
target="_blank">Ganglia</a> tool, and visualize results, all from a web
interface. This UI uses a number of Javascript libraries, among which <a
href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, <a
href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit" target="_blank">Simile Exhibit</a>,
and <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/"
target="_blank">Protovis</a> (now replaced by <a
href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>). On the
backend there is a number of RESTful APIs developed with Ruby and
Sinatra/Rails. The page that allows to graph metrics takes the data from an
API I developed on top of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-Robin_Database"
target="_blank">RRD</a> files generated by Ganglia.</p>

<h2>Grid'5000 API</h2>

<p> During three years at <a href="http://www.inria.fr"
target="_blank">Inria</a>, I was in charge of developing and deploying APIs on
top of the infrastructure tools of the <a href="https://www.grid5000.fr"
target="_blank">Grid'5000 platform</a>. Written in Ruby using a mix of Rails
and Sinatra applications, and implemented as HTTP APIs closely following the
constraints advocated by the REST architectural style, the infrastructure
receives more than 1 million hits per month. Server configuration is automated
using the <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">Puppet</a>
provisioning tool, and applications are distributed as Debian packages to
facilitate installation.</p>

<h2>OneStopNews</h2>

<p>Web application developed as a prototype for the framework described in one
of the <a href="/about/#publications">publications</a> I've written. It was a kind
of Google News website, but using Semantic analysis and aggregating videos in
addition to text articles and images (at the time, Google News did not show
relevant videos for news events). I used the <a
href="http://www.opencalais.com/" target="_blank">Calais</a> web service for
entity extraction. Developed using Rails for the frontend, and a variant of an
existing incremental hierarchical clustering algorithm.</p>
