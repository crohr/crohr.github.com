## Migrating a Legacy application

RubyOnRails is a very good framework, but it is evolving quite rapidly.
If you're stuck with an old version and can't make all the changes you'd
like to do because of it -- for instance you're stuck on a Rails 2.x
version with Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 -- I can help you migrate it quickly
and refactor where needed.
