Hello, my name is **Cyril Rohr**, and I'm currently working as a **Freelance**, based in Leamington Spa, UK.
I do **Ruby** and **Node.js** development, using frameworks such as
RubyOnRails, Sinatra, Goliath, and Express. Iâ€™m also interested in information
retrieval, machine learning techniques, distributed software architectures,
cloud computing, REST and HTTP APIs, and web development in general.

The good thing about me is that I'm a full stack engineer, meaning I can
handle everything from architecture design, development, and deployment in
production. If it looks like I may help you with your projects, please <a
href="/#contact">contact me</a>.
