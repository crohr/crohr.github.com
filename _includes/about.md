Hello, my name is **Cyril Rohr**, and I'm currently working as a **Freelance**
in France. I do **Ruby** and **Node.js** development, using frameworks such as
RubyOnRails, Sinatra, Goliath, and Express. I’m also interested in information
retrieval, machine learning techniques, distributed software architectures,
cloud computing, REST and HTTP APIs, and web development in general.

The good thing about me is that I'm a full stack engineer, meaning I can
handle everything from architecture design, development, and deployment in
production. If it looks like I may help you with your projects, please <a
href="/#contact">contact me</a>.
